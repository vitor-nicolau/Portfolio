This was my first portfolio. I was looking for something simple but good looking for me to use to show my work. 

I originally got most of it from CodePen, modified it to suit my liking and left it at the current state. My favourite thing about this portfolio is that the navbar changes color when the user moves down past a certain point. This was something I wanted to learn, so looked around google and found my solution, once I got it done, I realised how easy and useful JavaScript can be.

Eventually I wanted to build a new website, Portoflio 2.0!
